# Restaurant-management-system
Table Management:

The system supports the reservation and vacation of tables in a restaurant.
Tables are categorized based on their size (2-seater, 4-seater, and 6-seater).
Users can check the status of a specific table, reserve a table for a certain number of guests, and vacate a previously reserved table.
Delivery Order Management:

Customers can place orders for food delivery.
Each delivery order is assigned a unique order number.
The system tracks the status of each delivery order, including "order accepted," "preparing order," "order dispatched," and "order delivered."
Delivery Boy Management:

The system manages a pool of delivery boys, each with a unique user ID and password.
Delivery boys can mark themselves as available or unavailable.
Managers can assign delivery boys to dispatched orders.
Cook Management:

The system interacts with the kitchen staff or cooks for order preparation.
Cooks can accept orders for preparation and mark them as ready for dispatch.
Authentication and Authorization:

Different users, including managers, delivery boys, and cooks, have unique user IDs and passwords for authentication.
Access to certain functionalities is restricted based on user roles.
User Interface:

The system provides a menu-driven user interface, allowing users to choose from various options.
Prompts and messages guide users through the interaction process.
Security Considerations:

The system includes basic security measures, such as password verification for user authentication.
Delivery Boy Tracking:

Managers can track the availability of delivery boys and assign them to delivery orders.
Delivery Order Information Display:

Managers can view information about all delivery orders, including customer details, delivery addresses, and current status.
Exit and Error Handling:

The system allows users to exit gracefully and includes error handling for invalid inputs or unexpected situations.
Code Structure:

The code is organized into functions, each handling a specific aspect of the restaurant management system.
This project aims to streamline the operations of a restaurant by efficiently managing table reservations, food deliveries, and kitchen activities. Users with different roles can perform their respective tasks through a user-friendly interface, contributing to the overall efficiency of the restaurant management process.
